# Keith Barrette

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keithbarrette) is my preferred contact method for people I don't know personally.

Most of my public projects are on [GitHub](https://github.com/kbarrette), including my [jambeans](https://github.com/kbarrette/jambeans) vim color scheme, which is also used on this site.

I play mandolin in [Highway's End](https://highwaysend.com), my Americana band.

## Writings
[Basic harmonica for guitarists (and other musicians)]({% link writing/basic-harmonica-for-guitarists.md %}), a very short harmonica lesson for people who already play another instrument.

[A Christmas Carol]({% link writing/a-christmas-carol.md %}), a Dickensian D&D adventure.
