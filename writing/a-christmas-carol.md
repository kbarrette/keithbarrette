## Introduction to the Crabapples
* **Setting:** Inside Crabapple's house, around eleven at night
* **Characters:**
  * The *Crabapples* are gnomes
  * *Robert Crabapple*, town clerk of *Mayfair* - a strapping man.
  * *Mrs. Crabapple*, his wife - an attractive, sturdy woman, apparently
    with no first name.
  * *"Tiny" Timothy*, their son - a small, frail, sickly boy.
  * *Martha*, their daughter - a young woman just coming into her own.

> Your party has been away from the town of Mayfair for almost a month,
> collecting rare medical ingredients. The town clerk's son is ill and
> getting worse, and since the town seems unable to keep a healer for
> more than a week, the boy's father has turned to old women and their
> herbal remedies.
>
> Since you think of yourselves as good neighbors, a sort of
> "neighborhood watch," and if you're honest, the only people in town
> capable of finding the required plants, you agreed to make the trip.
>
> You have returned to town with the herbs late on Christmas Eve,
> and you encounter the town healer just outside the gates, leaving town.
>
> "Ah, it's you lot. Found the herbs, did you? Well, good thing. Young Master
> Crabapple is in a bad way."

She is a plump halfling. She is leaving town due to the evil influence of
Lady Avaricious, but expects the party to already know that.

**What would you like to do?**

As they give the herbs to Crabapple:

> Robert: Thank you so much! I know these will help..
>
> Martha: It'd help more if we could keep a healer in town for more than a week
>
> Robert: Martha...
>
> Martha (under her breath): Someone should do something about that wicked
> old miser Avaricious...
>
> Robert: MARTHA! You won't talk about my employer that way.

Since the players are likely familiar with *A Christmas Carol*, discovering
the setting is a fun surprise. Do not immediately give the players the
Crabapples' names, let them discover them naturally. Similarly, let them
learn about Lady Avaricious from the Crabapples.

The following information can be gleaned from the Crabapples:
* Their names, along with Lady Avaricious' name - upon learning these names, the
  players will likely recognize the setting.
* The town is ruled by a greedy master named *Lady Avaricious*, who only cares
  about accumulating wealth and prolonging her own life.
* Mrs. Crabapple and Martha will complain about taxes and Lady Avaricious,
  dropping Avaricious' name.
* The town is unable to keep a healer. They all leave after a week or two,
  complaining about an evil atmosphere.
* The Crabapples will think it "silly" that the party doesn't know who rules
  the town - "The master of the town is the same as when you left, of course:
  Lady Avaricious!" etc.

A **DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check** will reveal that Tim is very ill, with
an unidentifiable wasting disease, and curing him is far beyond the ability
of anyone in town, including the party.

Otherwise, this is a perfectly normal commoner's house.

As they leave, they encounter a spirit.

## Jacob Marley
* **Setting:** Just outside Crabapple's house, a few minutes before midnight

As the party leaves Crabapple’s house, they encounter the
ghost of *Jacob Marley*:

> You step outside into the bitter wind. There is a light snow falling.
> In the distance you hear the town's church bell begin to toll midnight,
> but another sound echoes through the deserted streets: a deep clanking,
> like someone dragging heavy chains across a row of empty wine barrels.
>
> The sound is unnerving enough, but it's what you see that truly
> chills your soul.
>
> A ghostly figure materializes a few yards in front of you. It appears to
> be a man in heavy coats, carrying an enormous chain. The links are wound
> around his waist and drag behind him, rattling across the cobblestones.
>
> He raises a spectral hand and points at you:
>
> "You have done well this day," the phantom says, "but before the
> night is over, much more will be required of you."
>
> In the distance the church bell continues to ring a fifth and then a
> sixth time. The spirit continues:
>
> "Avaricious' soul is in great peril, and should she fall into darkness,
> Mayfair will follow her. However, there is a way for you to save this
> town.
>
> Tonight Avaricious will be visited by three spirits. She must heed these
> ghosts' warnings if there is to be any hope for her redemption. The dark
> forces that hold her soul will fight to keep her from seeing the path
> toward light that these visions will offer.
>
> You must get yourselves into Avaricious' very bedchamber, and you must do
> it before the bell strikes one. Once there you must follow her on
> her journey and aid the noble spirits. Fight off the darkness that
> will come to claim her black soul. If you do not succeed, I fear there
> is hope for Avaricious, or for Mayfair."
>
> *Optionally:* Take these to help you on your journey.
>
> As the spirit finishes speaking, he backs slowly away and begins to fade.
> In the distance the church bells tolls; ten, eleven, and as the twelfth
> stroke ceases to chime, the spirit before you vanishes, swept away by the
> chill wind.

**What would you like to do?**

If it seems that the party will need healing, the ghost can leave behind
two **Potions of Healing** (**DMG pg. 188**) at the **DM's discretion**.

As good citizens, the players should want to help Avaricious. If not, remind
them that their town is in peril, and time is of the essence!

It is a 30 minute journey to Avaricious' manor by foot.

## The rush to Avaricious' Manor
* **Setting:** The streets of Mayfair, midnight
* **Enemies:** 4 Bandits; 3 Lemures and 1 Spined Devil
* This is is somewhat of a **skill challenge**

As the party moves toward Avaricious' manor, the snow begins to fall harder.

Challenges:
1. As the party encounters an intersection, the swirling snow confuses their
   senses, making it hard to recognize despite this being a familiar street.
   A **DC 15 Intelligence check** will allow them to remember the correct
   direction. Alternately, a resourceful use of tracking, etc may reveal
   the true path.

2. A crying child appears from an alley, saying that she is lost, the city
   guard has been disbanded, and she can't find her way home in the storm.

   > *sniff* I don't know how to get home! I was shopping with my mother,
   > but then the snow started, and I stopped to look in a shop window, and
   > she was gone. My mother always told me to ask a city guardsman
   > for help, but they're all gone, and I'm lost.

   This is a mugger's ambush, and within moments three thugs slip in from
   behind, immediately grappling the party.
   If the players quickly interrogate the girl, a **DC 10 Wisdom
   (Perception) check** reveals that she is lying. All four of these
   characters are **bandits** (**MM pg. 343**), and will run when injured.

3. A water cistern has burst and leaked, turning an entire street into ice. It
   takes a **DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) save** to make it across without
   slipping and taking fall damage.

4. The party finally arrives at Avaricious' manor. The house is a forbidding
   two-story building made of dark stone. There are no lights in the windows.
   A **DC 15 Wisdom (Perception)** check will reveal three Lemures
   (**MM pg. 76**) patrolling the shadows around the house. If not discovered,
   the Lemures will ambush the party as they approach. If not silenced
   quickly, they will begin to summon a Spined Devil (**MM pg. 78**),
   which will also attack the party.

## Avaricious’s Manor
* **Setting:** Avaricious’s manor
* **Enemies:** traps

The doors and windows are trapped, as if by some Victorian security system.

The manor is a forbidding two-story structure made of dark stone. It's not
too large, but it is larger than the houses around it. The windows are dark,
there is no smoke coming from the chimney -  the house appears to be asleep.
The front door of the manor is flanked by a pair of gargoyles.

**Front door:** The door knocker is in the form of a human face, scowling at
the viewer. If not disarmed, a spectral wolf will leap forward out of the
door knocker, biting at the opener for 2d6+3 piercing damage. A **DC 15
Intelligence (Investigation) check** will determine that the door is trapped,
and **DC 15 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools)** will disarm it.

**Kitchen (back) door:** The door is barred from inside, and is magically
sealed. A **DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check** will reveal the spell: the
door will not open unless the spell is dispelled or the door is broken
(**AC 13, 40 hit points**).

**Windows:** Simple mechanical locks, disabled with a **DC 15 Dexterity
(Thieves' Tools)** will bypass these locks.

The bottom floor is a normal Victorian house consisting of a hallway with
a dining room to the left, a parlor to the right, and a kitchen in the back.
There is nothing on the first floor except a normal house.

The second floor consists of Avaricious’s bedchamber and workshop, plus a
connecting bathroom.

Whichever room the party enters first is the workshop. There is a magic
circle on the floor, the worktables are covered in arcane miscellany, and
the walls are lined with bookcases full of obscure texts.

A **DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check** will reveal that this equipment is
used as part of the process of becoming a lich.

Outside the bedchamber, they can hear muted conversation between the childlike
Ghost of Christmas Past and Avaricious. They then hear the sound of wind, as
if blowing through an open window. The ghost says "Come, time grows short."

> As you enter Lady Avaricious’s bedchamber, you see her disappear through a
> swirling portal, tucking a pocket watch into her nightshirt as she does so.
> As she disappears, she notices you and exclaims "Wait! What are you doing
> in my house?!" but a childlike hand reaches out from the portal and pulls
> her through.
>
> In the distance, you hear the town clock begin to chime.

**What would you like to do?**

The players must enter the portal to follow Avaricious before it closes.

The players must "keep up" with Avaricious. If they are reticent to open the
door to her bedchamber or to follow her through the portal, have them make
a Wisdom check, and the high rollers hear Marley's voice whisper in their
minds: "After them, before the bell tolls one!"

## Haunting 1: Christmas Past
* **Setting:** Avaricious’ boarding school
* **Enemies:** 1 Bearded Devil and 2 Imps

The players come through the portal to find themselves just inside the door of
a one-room schoolhouse. As they appear, a pack of squealing children run
directly through them, out the door. The players don't feel a thing. The
walls and floor feel solid enough, but the people here are insubstantial.

They see Avaricious and the Ghost of Christmas Past, but cannot
interact with them. If they continue to attempt to do so, the ghost will
acknowledge their presence but otherwise remain non-interactive. They also
see a young woman speaking to the headmaster regarding her entry into the
business world. They cannot interact with these figures either.

> *Headmaster:* You have almost completed your studies, Avaricious.
>
> *Young Avaricious:* Yes, headmaster.
>
> *Headmaster:* It is time for you to enter the world of business. You will
> like business.
>
> *Young Avaricious:* Yes, headmaster.
>
> *Headmaster:* You must uphold the reputation of our esteemed institution!
> Be tough, but fair, honest yet firm, and advance the cause of humanity!
>
> *Young Avaricious:* Yes, headmaster.

As this unfolds, a **Bearded Devil** (**MM pg. 70**) and two **Imps**
(**MM pg. 76**) appear and attempt to disrupt the vision by attacking the
ghost. The ghost cannot react for fear of spoiling the effect on Avaricious,
and implores the party for help. The players must intervene, and defeat
the devils.

> The ghost turns to you, and in her chiming voice whispers: "Help me! I
> MUST concentrate on the vision!"

**Roll initiative**

During the fight, the scenery shifts around the party. The schoolhouse
is the same, but it now contains Avaricious in her late teens and a young
woman. The woman turns with tears in her eyes and rushes out the door, and
Avaricious just watches her go.

As the enemy is defeated, Avaricious begins to question the path she has taken,
acknowledging that this is her past:

> With a look of thanks, the ghost opens a new portal and ushers Avaricious
> through it, gesturing for you to follow.
>
> You hear Avaricious saying "Spirit, I recognize that this is my past, but why
> show me this? Surely not my promise to the headmaster - that was a child's
> promise, wasn't it? And Belle? Some things are not meant to be."

## Haunting 2: Christmas Present
* **Setting:** Inside Crabapple’s house
* **Enemies:** 1 Barbed Devil, 1 Spined Devil, 2 Imps

If it seems that the players need it, you may tell them "As you exit the
portal, you feel the effects of a short rest."

The players come through the second portal and find themselves inside
Crabapple's house. The previous ghost is nowhere to be seen, but in its place
is a large, jovial, bearded man: the Ghost of Christmas Present.

The ghost and Avaricious peer through the windows from outside the house as
the Crabapples celebrate Christmas, Robert toasting his employer as his wife
and daughter reluctantly agree. Tim is visibly ill.

As before, the players cannot interact with these figures.

This time a **Barbed Devil** (**MM pg. 70**), a **Spined Devil**
(**MM pg. 78**) and a pair of **Imps** (**MM pg. 76**) appear outside the
house and attempt to destroy it, along with the ghost.

The ghost once more asks for help.

**Roll initiative**

As the devils are defeated, the ghost once again opens a portal and ushers
Avaricious through it. As she disappears, Avaricious, visibly shaken, asks
"Must Tim die?" This ghost actively holds open the portal for the players and
gestures for them to follow.

> With a wave of his arm, the spirit produces a familiar-looking portal,
> and ushers Avaricious through. As she passes, you year Avaricious asking:
> "Crabapple's son doesn't look well. Why doesn't someone heal him?" to which
> the spirit replies "No healer will remain in this place for long, Avaricious,
> as well you know." On Avaricious' face, you can see a look of dismay, as her
> hand strays to the pocket watch around her neck.
>
> The spirit holds open the portal for you, beckoning you to follow.

## Haunting 3: Christmas Future
* **Setting:** a graveyard overlooking the town, just before dawn
* **Enemies:** 1 Lich

The portal deposits the players in the churchyard overlooking the city.
The are slightly disoriented but eventually realize where they are.

A pall of foul darkness hangs in the air, and they can see the town
below them, looking derelict.

Further investigation reveals that the town is almost deserted, the buildings
marred by broken windows and crumbling chimneys.

They see Avaricious and a tall, gaunt, black-robed Ghost of Christmas Future
ascend the hilltop. This time, the party CAN interact with Avaricious, although
the ghost is inscrutable.

Avaricious again asks the party what they are doing here. She asks the ghost
if this is the future, but receives no response. The ghost gestures
down the hill as:

> Another thin, cloaked figure appears, walking straight toward you.
> As it walks, you see it glance toward a particular stone
> (marked "Avaricious")
>
> As it approaches, you can see the figure's face is drawn and emaciated, like
> leather wrapped tightly across its skull. An aura of palpable evil
> surrounds it.

A **DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation or Arcana) check** reveals that this is
a Lich (**MM pg. 202**), and it is Avaricious.

> Avaricious, seeing this figure, recognizes it and howls "No! I will not be
> the person I was. I will not become this monster!"
>
> As she says this, her hand once again grasps pocket watch around her neck.

A **DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check** will reveal that the pocket watch is
her phylactery.

> The lich (for that is obviously what it is), approaches, moving directly
> into your midst.
>
> As the lich passes, it turns and makes a sudden sniffing noise, like a dog
> catching a scent on the breeze. Its dry lips crack into an evil smile as it
> makes a gesture in the air, as if parting a curtain. Its red eyes find yours,
> and a thin cackle breaks the air.

**Roll initiative**

At this level, the players cannot defeat a Lich, and it will likely kill
some of them - this is intentional. Avaricious must must destroy it
(and herself) by destroying the pocket watch. She knows this, and will all
but suggest it.

The players must help her make the right choice: a few **DC 10 Charisma
(Persuasion) checks** will convince Avaricious; she wants to make the right
choice.

If Avaricious does destroy the phylactery, the lich will disappear, the party
will appear on the street outside Avaricious' house on Christmas morning.
Avaricious throws open the shutters and exclaims about not "missing it."

If Avaricious does not destroy the phylactery, the Lich will destroy the party.
It will grab Avaricious and open a corrupted portal to the past, intending to
ensure its own existence.
